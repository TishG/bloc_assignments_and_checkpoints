Give written answers for each question and put them in linked-lists-answers.txt:

What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

pros- never contains empty placeholders, each node is independent in memory, node lists can easily grow to large sizes
cons- inefficient to access an element as you have to search every element from the beginning until you find the element you were searching for.

Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

You are at an old library looking for a book about JavaScript, you had previously seen online that it was available. You find a large shelf of books for programming languages. The books are lined up next to each other and out of order. You scan each book and 40 minutes later, you find the book you were looking for.

Programming Questions
You may program the following questions in any language of your choice (JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

Before beginning to code, write out a plan explaining how to solve the question.

The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 SET current to head
 SET current.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION

Functional implementation:
class NodeList {
  constructor(element) {
    this.head = null;
    this.length = 0;
    this.push(element); //bind the method
  }
  push(element) {
    const newNode = { element }
  }
}

Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a

FUNCTION reverseNode(node)
  WHILE no
