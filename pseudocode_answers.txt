Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

To express what their code should do to develop algorithms.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

It will not run because it is only meant for humans to read rather than machines.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT number1 and number2
IF number1 is greater than number2
  PRINT number1
ELSE IF number2 is greater than number1
  PRINT number2
ELSE
  PRINT "even"
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

START FOR
  number = 1
  WHILE number is <= 100
  Add 1 to number
  PRINT number
END FOR

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION nameSearch(arr, name)
 SEARCH each name in the array
  IF name = array item
    PRINT "Found (name)"
  ELSE Print "Could not find (name)"
  END IF
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function nameSearch(arr, name) {
  for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(name === arr[i]) {
        return "Found: " + name;
    }
  } return "Could not find: " + name;
}

INPUT NUMBER 1
WHILE NUMBER is less than or equal to 100
  ADD 1
END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Input NAME
IF NAME equals "Null, Lucy"
  PRINT "Null, Lucy found"
ELSE IF NAME does not equal "Null, Lucy"
  PRINT "That name could not be found"
END IF

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findName(lastName, firstName) {
  if(lastName === "Null" && firstName === "Lucy") {
    return "Lucy Null found";
} else if (lastName !== "Null" && firstName !== "Lucy") {
    return "That name could not be found";
  }
}
