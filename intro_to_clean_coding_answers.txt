1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.

Clean code is the idea of writing code that is maintainable and readable.

2. Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard.

Traffic Lights are commonly used objects that rely on computers. If the code was not to an acceptable standard, more accidents would be likely to occur.

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

The following is not clean code because:
-Code is not self documenting
-There are too many comments
-parameters and function is not properly named
-function is not nested correctly
-not DRY

FUNCTION do(x, y)               // Creating a new function
 IF y = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
 SET z to (x−32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 ELSE IF y = "C" THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION

Refactored:

function convertTemperature(degreesNumber, degreesType) {
let x = degreesNumber;
let y = degreesType;
  if(typeof x !== "number" ) {
    return "please enter a number for the first parameter";
  }
  else if(y = "f" || "F") {
    return (x-32) * 5/9 + " degrees Celsius";
  }
  else if (y = "c" || "C") {
    return x * 1.8000 + 32.00 + " degrees Fahrenheit";
  }
}

4. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

I consider the example below to be clean code.
Because:
-self-documenting
-nested appropriately
-functions and parameters are named within standard
-code is DRY

*Some may argue that the function name should be calculatePercent(sum,total) instead of calcPercent(sum, total) but I was able to understand what the function was meant to do with the original function name.

FUNCTION calcPercent(sum, total)
 IF NOT(total = 0) THEN
     SET percentage to sum / total * 100
 ELSE
   PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
 END IF

 PRINT percentage
END FUNCTION

5. Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the principles you have learned in this checkpoint.

a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and receives payment accordingly.

FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   END IF
END FUNCTION

Refactered:
FUNCTION transaction(subTotal, discount, paymentType, amountPayed) {
tax = 0.06
totalDue = total * discount + (total * tax)
  PRINT "Your total due is: " + totalDue;
  IF PaymentTYPE = 'CASH' THEN
    PRINT "Change due: " + amountPayed - totalDue
  ELSE IF PaymentTYPE = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
      PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + totalDue
  END IF
END FUNCTION

b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the guest's account.

FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive THEN
     IF NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) THEN
         IF guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
           APPEND book to guest.books
           SET book.status to "Checked Out"
           PRINT "Your books have been issued."
         END IF
     END IF
 ELSE
     PRINT "Unable to check out book."
 END IF
END FUNCTION
c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions a customer can perform at an ATM.

CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION

 ....
 ....
 ....

Programming Questions
You may do the following problems in any language of your choice. Use the clean code principles taught in this section while writing the code.

6. Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root, otherwise return the sum.

Example:
[10,1,4,6,1,1,2] returns 5 because the square root of 25 is 5.
[1,1] returns 2 because 2 is not a perfect square.
The square root of 2 is approximately 1.414213562373095.

7. Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

8. Anagram An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, spar can be formed from rasp. Given two strings, stringOne and stringTwo, determine if stringOne is an anagram of stringTwo. Assume that the strings contain only lowercase letters and do not worry about case-sensitivity. Hint: Your first task will be to convert the strings to arrays.
